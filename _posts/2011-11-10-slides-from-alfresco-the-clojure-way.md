I just gave a talk at the Alfresco DevCon 2011 in London, and I published the slides at slideshare:

<div class="aligncenter" style="width:425px" id="__ss_10104981">
<iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/10104981" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

There's also an <a href="http://slidesha.re/uqUqOW">extended version</a> of the presentation that I originally wrote, which ended up being too big for the time slot I had.

Hope you either enjoyed the talk or the slides, next steps are getting to <a href="https://github.com/skuro">Github</a> and fork <a href="https://github.com/skuro/lambdalf">lambdalf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/skuro/spring-webscripts-addon-clojure">clojure webscripts</a> away!
