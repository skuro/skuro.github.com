Some time ago I published an initial version of H2 support for Alfresco. While it's still quite an experimental version, it proved to work fine for Alfresco v3.3+. Support for in memory databases is instrumental in easily creating integration and unit tested application or integration, and interest in having Alfresco running with H2 already has at least two happy users. As it's proving itself quite a useful tool, it was just time to make some good Open Source housekeeping. First step: licensing.

MIT License
-----------

Thou shalt make no other software before Open Source. But licensing is incredibly tricky. There are simply gazillions of [OSI](http://www.opensource.org/) approved [licenses](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical), some filled with so much legal mambo-jambo that your head might explode. But even for the legalese illiterates such as the truly yours, there's still hope to make a better world with Open Source and still keep your sanity: let me introduce you the MIT license

>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

And that's it. Clean, direct and useful. As software engineers, we can't deny there's even beauty in such a concise and fundamental license.
