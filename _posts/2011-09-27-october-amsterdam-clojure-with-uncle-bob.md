I'm very excited to announce that we have finalized the details, and Wednesday, October 12th we're going to have a great <a href="http://bit.ly/ams-clj">Amsterdam Clojure meetup</a>, with great talks and an awesome guest speaker: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/unclebobmartin">"Uncle" Bob Martin</a> from <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/">Object Mentor</a> and of <a href="http://www.cleancoders.com/">Clean Coders</a> fame.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.sourcesense.com">Sourcesense</a>, which is once again backing up and ultimately allowing this event to happen in an awesome location such as the <a href="http://www.dezwijger.nl/">Pakhuis de Zwijger</a>, I look forward to meet a number of Clojure enthusiast, newcomers or tired Java developers looking for something new.

We have limited seating possibilities, so make sure to register at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Amsterdam-Clojure-Meetup-Group/events/33351892/">meetup official page</a> to ensure there will be a spot for you!
