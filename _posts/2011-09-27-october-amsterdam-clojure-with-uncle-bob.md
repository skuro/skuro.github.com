I'm very excited to announce that we have finalized the details, and
Wednesday, October 12th we're going to have a great [Amsterdam Clojure meetup](http://bit.ly/ams-clj)", with great talks and an awesome guest speaker: ["Uncle" Bob Martin](http://twitter.com/#!/unclebobmartin) from [Object Mentor](http://www.objectmentor.com/) and of [Clean Coders](http://www.cleancoders.com/) fame.

Thanks to [Sourcesense](http://www.sourcesense.com), which is once again backing up and ultimately allowing this event to happen in an awesome location such as the [Pakhuis de Zwijger](http://www.dezwijger.nl/), I look forward to meet a number of Clojure enthusiast, newcomers or tired Java developers looking for something new.

We have limited seating possibilities, so make sure to register at the [meetup official page](http://www.meetup.com/The-Amsterdam-Clojure-Meetup-Group/events/33351892/) to ensure there will be a spot for you!
