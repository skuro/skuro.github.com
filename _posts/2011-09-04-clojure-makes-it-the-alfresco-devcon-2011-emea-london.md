If you're a bit into Alfresco, you surerly know what the <a href="http://www.amiando.com/alfresco-devcon-london-2011.html">DevCon</a> is. 

To use the same words from <a href="http://blogs.alfresco.com/wp/devcon/2011/08/04/save-the-date-alfresco-devcon-san-diego-london/">Jeff Potts</a>:
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
<blockquote>the premier event for digging into the details of the Alfresco platform and collaborating with others who are doing the same</blockquote>
Now, as soon as I received the <a href="http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2011/08/09/1449">CallForPapers</a> I immediately (and impulsively!) submitted a talk named <em>Alfresco, the Clojure way</em> in the Customizing Alfresco track, where I wanted to introduce to enthusiastic Alfresco developers how to do their job using a fantastic <a href="http://clojure.org">programming language</a>. It was just last week that I was notified that yes, my talk made it to the conference schedule! Clojure goes to London!

It will be great chance for Clojure to prove itself a great tool, and to get some more exposure to software professionals around Europe and beyond. Now that things got serious, I really need to put my presentation together, and that's where you can provide some help.

I still don't know the time slot the presentation will be given, but surely enough I'll publish online the full version of it as soon as I'll be back from London. The following is the initial list of topics I'd like to cover, but I'm eager to know from you what you would like to add to it.

High level topics
-----------------

<ul>
	<li>crash-course on <a href="http://clojure.org/reader">Clojure syntax</a></li>
	<li>extremely fast digression on some core language features and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> topics</li>
	<li>introduction to <a href="https://github.com/skuro/lambdalf">lambdalf</a>, a Clojure adapter to the Alfresco <a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Java_Foundation_API">Foundation API</a></li>
	<li>introduction to the <a href="https://github.com/skuro/spring-webscripts-addon-clojure">Clojure addon</a> for the Spring Web Script framework</li>
	<li>show and tell: start Alfresco, start a <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure">swank</a> server and do live coding against the repository</li>
	<li><em>OPTIONAL:</em> showcase a Clojure-based <a href="https://github.com/skuro/lambdalf-samples">sample</a> Alfresco application</li>
</ul>
Again, I don't know how much time I'll be given, so I can't even guarantee I'll have time for all the above topics to get a proper introduction, but since I also might have still enough time to cover other topics, what would you like to see in there?
