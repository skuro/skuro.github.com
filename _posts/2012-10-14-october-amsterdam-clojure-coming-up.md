meta-description: The biggest Clojure FREE event in the Netherlands, now at its third edition
---

Saturday, October 27th. Less than two weeks. That's the time when
October Amsterdam Clojure, the biggest Clojure free event in the
Netherlands, will be up on stage. I'm so incredibly excited about it,
I can't wait to see all the seasoned clojurians, passionate
technologists and curious newbies meet together to discuss one of the
most intriguing technologies of our present day. Here's a couple of
things to remind you of what's ahead of us.

Don't forget to bring a ticket
==============================

As much as the event is totally free to attend, our limited logistics
imposes us a limit on the attendance. In order to reserve your seat at
the event, just go on the event
[Meetup page](http://bit.ly/octamsclj-register) and RSVP. This much,
and you'll be joining us and have full access to the conference.

How to reach us
===============

As it goes with all Amsterdam Clojurians regular meetup, the big
October event will be also hosted by
[Backbase](http://www.backbase.com). You can find the [directions to
the venue](http://www.backbase.com/contact/DIRECTIONS-backbase-INIT.pdf) on the official [event page](http://amsclj.nl/october.html).
While it's not far from Central Station, make sure to take note of the
correct address. Once you're in the neighborhood, it's easy to find
us: just go to the main entrance of the big, glass building with the
huge newspapers logos on top. Yes,
[that one](http://www.cctvinfo.com/news_images/Geutebruck_INIT_building_ext.gif).
You'll find some of our awesome Clojurian volunteer to wait for you
downstairs.

Afterparty drinkup
==================

We're still in the process of organizing a drinkup right after the
event, make sure your agenda is free in order to join the swarm of
Clojure coders and discuss functional programming philosophies over a
couple of beers!

Stay up to date
===============

Events are complex beasts, and we'll try hard to let you always be up
to date with any sudden change of the plan. If you want to double
