These days some milestones have been placed that are both consolidating past efforts and promising great improvements on maven based processes around <a href="http://www.alfresco.com">Alfresco ECM</a>.

First and foremost, to prove the Alfresco commitment in mavenizing the product, have a look at their hosted <a href="http://sonatype.com/">Sonatype</a> <a href="http://maven.alfresco.com">Nexus instance</a>. Even if big changes <a href="http://maven.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/alfresco/alfresco/3.2r/alfresco-3.2r.pom">are still due</a>, you'll be more than happy to find Alfresco dismembered in maven artifacts, each one with it's POM. Most of them are just a kind of placeholders, but here and there you can find some <a href="http://maven.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/alfresco/alfresco-jlan/3.3.0-preview-1/alfresco-jlan-3.3.0-preview-1.pom">hints</a> of what they're going to be.

Aside, the same Nexus instance also offers a new home for the <a href="http://maven.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/releases/com/sourcesense/">components</a> developed within <a href="http://www.sourcesense.com">Sourcesense </a>that up until now are the only way to <a href="http://mindthegab.com/2009/11/07/maven-alfresco-lifecycle-to-gather-all-maven-alfresco-components/">leverage Maven when dealing with Alfresco</a>.

A <a href="http://mindthegab.com/2009/12/02/dreams-come-true-launching-the-alfresco-community-maven-repository/">great post</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/mindthegabz">the guy</a> that made it happen will provide you more and more <a href="http://maven.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/alfresco-docs/maven-alfresco-lifecycle/index.html">insights</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/maven-alfresco-archetypes/">pointers</a> and stuff. All with a Maven taste.
