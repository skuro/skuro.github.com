Packt Publishing recently proposed me to review their new <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/apache-maven-3-0-cookbook/book">book</a> <em>Maven 3 Cookbook</em> written by <a href="http://srirangan.net/">Srirangan</a>. I just received a copy of the book, I'll start reading it immediately and provide my review in a future blog post here.

In the meanwhile, here's the book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/apache-maven-3-0-cookbook/book">home page</a> where to find the detailed <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/toc/apache-maven-3-cookbook-table-contents">table of contents</a> and a sample chapter.
