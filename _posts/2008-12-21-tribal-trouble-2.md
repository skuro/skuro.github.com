One of the best way i found to trash my time during these days of sad loneliness, apart from trying to shape this blog the best I can, is <a title="Tribal Trouble 2 Homepage" href="http://tribaltrouble2.com" target="_blank">Tribal Trouble 2</a>. It's a 3D fast paced strategy game, and the best things are that it's entirely written in Java&trade; and with <a alt="JNLP technology" href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/jnlp/">JNLP</a> it starts directly from your browser, i.e. no installation required!

I'm still at the Boot Camp level, a little tutorial campaign which teaches you how to play, but I got completely lost with this at the first glance.

In the game you're the chief of a barbarian tribe and have to guide it in order to gather resources, lay down some buildings, attach enemies... the usual stuff.

Anyway, the overall impression on the game is really positive: it's like a quick-and-dirty Warcraft2 with funny animations and goofy characters you can play from everywhere. It's still in beta, so there could be something broken, but on the other hand they accepts free subscriptions :)

See you in the game!
