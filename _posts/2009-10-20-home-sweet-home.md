Ok, the migration should be now complete and the DNS updated. Moving a wordpress instance is not that smooth thing I hoped, but I've found some <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2007/10/01/how-to-move-wordpress-blog-to-new-domain-or-location/">useful tips</a> that allowed me to do it quickly. Now, these pages are served by a Debian VPS from the US, more precisely:

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr><td>IP Address:</td><td>64.208.167.70</td></tr>
<tr><td>Location:</td><td>UNITED STATES,</td></tr>
<tr><td>Latitude / Longitude:</td><td>38.9048 LATITUDE, -77.0354 LONGITUDE</td></tr>
<tr><td>Connecting through:</td><td>GLOBAL CROSSING</td></tr>
<tr><td>Time Zone:</td><td>UTC -05:00</td></tr>
<tr><td>Net Speed:</td><td>DIAL</td></tr>
<tr><td>IDD Code:</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Weather Station:</td><td>USDC0001 - WASHINGTON</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

Now, if it happens to you to see anything weird on these pages, please shout out loud! :)

See you soon.
