This little piece of blogosphere is owned by `skuro`, a.k.a. Carlo
Sciolla. I'm an IT professional by day and Clojurian,
meetup organizer, open source developer, biker and, well, blogger by
night.

Work stuff
------------------------

I grew up from fiddling with embedded linux systems, to mobile
development, to mainstream Java&trade; backend development. I got
certified as an [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com) Recognized Developer on 2011.

I currently work at [Backbase](http://www.backbase.com), where I act
as a Product Lead and content/ECM expert.

Clojure
-------

This awesome functional programming [language](http://clojure.org) is the current sink of most of my spare time. Besides coding, I try to contribute to its already great community by organizing the [Amsterdam Clojurians Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-Amsterdam-Clojure-Meetup-Group/).

Open Source
-----------

There simply isn't any other way of doing software (said the guy that
works for a closed source software company). I contribute at different
levels to the following open source projects:
