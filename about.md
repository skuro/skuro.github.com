title: About me
---

This little piece of blogosphere is owned by `skuro`, a.k.a. Carlo
Sciolla. I'm an IT professional by day and Clojurian,
meetup organizer, opensource develoepr, biker and, well, blogger by
night.

Not so boring work stuff
------------------------

I currently work at [backbase](http://www.backbase.com), where I act
as a developer and content/ECM expert.

Open Source
-----------

There simply isn't any other way of doing software (said the guy that
works for a closed source software company). I contribute at different
levels to the following open source projects:

* [`lambdalf`](https://github.com/skuro/lambdalf) -- Clojure bridge for Alfresco
* [`spring-webscripts-clojure-plugin`] -- The name tells it all
* [`maven-alfresco-archetypes`](code.google.com/p/maven-alfresco-archetypes/) -- 'Cause `maven` can be good
