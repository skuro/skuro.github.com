  <blockquote><p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I moved from Wordpress to <a href="github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, you can now find the sources for this blog on <a href="https://github.com/skuro/skuro.github.com">Github</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It has been a great adventure to host my blog on a private machine for <a href="http://skuro.tk/2009/10/20/home-sweet-home/">more than two years</a>. Setting up everything, in a pure DIY fashion, has been instructive and a funny journey. Unfortunately, there were a number of reasons why a privately hosted <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> instance was not optimal anymore.</p>

<p>I also gave the whole blog a new look, shamelessly copying much of <a href="http://zachholman.com">Zach Holman</a> design, I think it greatly improves readibility. Feedback welcome!</p>

<h2>Going down</h2>

<p>It first happened at the beginning of this year that <a href="http://skuro.tk/2011/01/24/performance-boost-in-clojure-1-3">one of my posts</a> attracted a good deal of attention. While it wasn't really that big thing, 2k requests/hour were enough to drain every bit of available memory my VPS had to offer, thus repeatedly killing my whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle">LAMP</a>) system down. It has to be noted that I'm no PHP nor Wordpress expert, and I was also so sloppy to let every single <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">apache</a> process (-> request) suck up to a round 20MB. No wander my machine went down, and while I was able to finally handle 1k request/hour order of magnitude <a href="http://skuro.tk/2011/09/04/clojure-makes-it-the-alfresco-devcon-2011-emea-london">several</a> <a href="http://skuro.tk/2011/09/27/october-amsterdam-clojure-with-uncle-bob">times</a> <a href="http://skuro.tk/2011/11/10/slides-from-alfresco-the-clojure-way">later</a> on, it was everytime on the edge of the catastrophe. It was clear to me that my Wordpress blog was to be replaced.</p>

<p>Note: I'm not saying LAMP + Wordpress is not a good option for a personal blog, it just wasn't an attractive option for me to get into the details of how to make it robust enough in my case.</p>

<h2>Static content</h2>

<p>PHP allows for highly dynamic content via server side rendering. Cool, but does a blog <em>really</em> need such power? The reality is that most of the pages served by a blog are the same almost all the time.Apart from when you create a new post, there's hardly any difference in a page in its whole lifetime. All the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=896744">features</a> you might get out of a blog engine such as Wordpress are in my case of no real use.</p>

<p>Static content was appealing from a number of reasons: lightweight, plain HTML and resources (JS, CSS). The whole site fits in my mental picture quite easily. I needed only a thin layer that would allow me to use a more convenient interface to the presentation layer than HTML.</p>

<h2>Github Pages and Jekyll</h2>

<p>I did some initial experiments with a fully custom <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> blog engine, where I explored various combinations of <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki">Compojure</a>, <a href="http://webnoir.org/">Noir</a>, <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive">Enlive</a>, etc. While it was a nice exercise, it was really more of a technical exercise which wasn't getting me nowhere, as I kept running in circles while picking up new technologies every other day. <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> was there, tempting me all along the way: I already loved <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, and delegating the whole infrastructure to Github was eventually tackling the very core of my original issues with hosting my own blog. It was when I found a great <a href="http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/">migration guide</a> that I couldn't deny anymore Github hosted <a href="github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> was the best option I had.</p>

<h2>Emacs, of course</h2>

<p>Migrating to Jekyll took just a couple of days, I even wrote my first Ruby <a href="https://github.com/skuro/skuro.github.com/blob/sources/_plugins/categories.rb">code</a> ever. Everything looked pretty promising, but I needed an extra step: there was no point in having a plain text interface if I couldn't use the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">Almighty Emacs&trade;</a> editor as the main interface to my blog. Sure thing, I wasn't the first to think so, and I promptly found an <a href="http://metajack.im/2009/01/02/manage-jekyll-from-emacs/">initial implementation</a> I could use to start walking the Emacs way.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I'm writing this very post from Emacs. And it feels good.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>With this first post I just started feeling the good parts of my new setup. There are huge areas of improvements here and there, but hey, for just a 4 days job I can't be more happy!</p>
